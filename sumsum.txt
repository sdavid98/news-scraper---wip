New York (CNN Business) Airbnb is laying off about 25% of its workforce as the coronavirus pandemic upends the travel industry and threatens the company's core business. "We are collectively living through the most harrowing crisis of our lifetime, and as it began to unfold, global travel came to a standstill," Airbnb CEO and cofounder Brian Chesky said in a letter to employees He added that Airbnb's business has been "hit hard" and revenue this year is expected to be less than half of what the company earned in 2019. The company has recently dabbled with virtual versions of its Airbnb Experiences , which feature hosts from more than 30 countries leading activities and range in price from $1 to $40. Experiences include online bike tours, meditating with a Japanese monk or taking a Moroccan cooking class. In the US, Airbnb said it will cover 12 months of health insurance for its employees through COBRA. Airbnb has also grappled with appeasing frustrated customers with refunds, and supporting its hosts, many of whom are struggling to make mortgage payments and pay bills due to coronavirus-related cancellations.
